                <h2>DNA Matching</h2>
                <p>We don’t randomly suggest universities or courses or countries, your careers aren’t random for us. 15+ years of industry experience has given us enough data to precisely match DNA of your skills and aspirations with the course/country/university
                    that would value it most.</p>

                <h2>University Ananlysis</h2>
                <p>Universities have a student short listing checklist and you should have one for universities too. After we’ve matched you to a set of universities, we then use a custom tool kit that rates universities on Faculty/ Alumni/Resources format
                    and ranks them to best suit you.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Application Mentoring</h2>
                <p>Once we’re sure of course/country/universities our mentors start the extensively collaborative process of constructing application drafts. International mentors use their in-country experience and extensive research on faculty/ alumni/
                    resources to ensure your application stand out.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <div class="product-common-faq-container">
            <div class="product-common-faq-inner">
                <h5>Will your consultant share/ refer essays that have been successful in the past for other students?</h5>
                <p>Yes, the consultant will share reference Essays of students who have applied to same universities/courses in the past. In addition to this the consultant will also share a specialised book that details the explanation of 50 Essays for
                    Tier 1 universities.</p>
                <h5>Are there dedicated sessions to discuss the students profile/ambition/skills that need to come in the essay? How many?</h5>
                <p>On an average there will be 2-3 sessions specifically to brainstorm a dedicated questionnaire that focuses on getting answers that will bring out the students profile/ambitions and skills which then can be used by editors to write an excellent
                    SOP.
                </p>
                <h5>Would the drafts of the Essay/SOP be written by experts or the students?</h5>
                <p>The answers to the questionnaires will be submitted by students, there will be discussion on how to answer them and samples will be provided. Once the student answers these questions the drafts will be prepared by the team of a consultant
                    and an editor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="product-common-faq-inner">
                <h5>How many sessions can I expect to have with the consultant if I have doubts?</h5>
                <p>Usually there are 2 sessions earmarked specifically to discuss the university specific doubts students have for the questions for different university applications.</p>
                <h5>Are there any specific tools to help the students write the details that are needed for the SOP?</h5>
                <p>Yes there are custom built tool kits, questionnaires, samples and a SOP book written by the inhouse team.</p>
                <h5>Is there a particular format one must follow to write a successful Essay/SOP?</h5>
                <p>There is no particular format but the students must focus on aligning their dreams and aspirations with the DNA of the university. The SOP must be concise and should target the specific information that the reader wants to read. The consultant
                    deep dive and tailor essays individually for each student as per needs.
